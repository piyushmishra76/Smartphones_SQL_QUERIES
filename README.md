# Smartphones_SQL_QUERIES

## Project Description
This Smartphones_SQL_QUERIES contains SQL queries applied on a smartphones dataset to explore, filter, aggregate, and sort data.  
Queries include: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, and various aggregate functions.  
It’s designed to demonstrate practical SQL skills on real-world datasets.

## Folder/Files Description
- `SQL_SELECT_ALLCOMMANDS.sql` → Basic `SELECT` queries, filtering, and simple calculations.  
- `SQL_Grouping_Sorting.sql` → Grouping, aggregation, `HAVING` clause, and sorting queries.  
- `SQL_INSERTandEXTRACOMMAND.sql` -> basic insertion to the table and multiple value insertion 
## How to Run Queries
You can run the SQL files in MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or any SQL IDE.

## Coming Soon
- JOIN queries (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)  
- Subqueries (nested queries, correlated subqueries)  
- Advanced SQL functions and conditional aggregation
